    \nEnglish villagers were able to store their harvest in inventory. Yet, despite\
    \ facing starvation from future crop failure, they rarely stored enough to get\
    \ beyond the following year. Dynamic economic models of decision-making, calibrating\
    \ parameters from historical data, resolves the puzzle. The power of dynamic programming\
