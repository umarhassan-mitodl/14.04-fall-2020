    \ Prof. Robert Townsend\n\nView the complete course: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/14-04-intermediate-microeconomic-theory-fall-2020/\n\

    \nIn modern economies with financial markets, a good stock is one that hedges\
    \ aggregate risk, having high return when the rest of the market does poorly,\
    \ on average. A stock which in contrast co-moves with the market bears a risk\
    \ premium, to compensate for its failure to hedge market risk. In Thai village\
    \ economies, no stocks are traded, and yet amazingly, the returns on real capital\
    \ assets, from running small business and farms, are consistent with the theory.\n\
