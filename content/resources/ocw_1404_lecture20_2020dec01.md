    \nWhen there is pollution, missing markets, externalities in caring about the\
    \ outcomes for other people (jealousy or altruism), or an infinite number of agents\
    \ from overlapping generations of finite-lived agents, then the equivalence between\
    \ the class of competitive equilibria with transfers and the set of Pareto optimal\
    \ allocations can be broken. But likewise, the link can be restored with markets\
    \ in rights and appropriate market design.\n\nLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA\n\
