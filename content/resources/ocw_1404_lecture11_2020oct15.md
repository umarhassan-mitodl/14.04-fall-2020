  youtube_description: "MIT 14.04 Intermediate Microeconomic Theory, Fall 2020\nInstructor:\
    \ Prof. Robert Townsend\n\nView the complete course: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/14-04-intermediate-microeconomic-theory-fall-2020/\n\

    \nWhat exactly are smart contracts? The theory of mechanism design and the protocols\
    \ for validation of decentralized ledgers are compared. Trust means different\
    \ things to different people. Yet economics and computer science can come together.\
    \ The tools of incentive compatibility, encryption, platforms, and programmability\
    \ are explained and featured in key applications.\n\nLicense: Creative Commons\
