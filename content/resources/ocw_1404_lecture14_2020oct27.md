    \nVillages and towns are like small open economies within a nation, yet the SMEs\
    \ within them are heterogeneous in wealth and productivity. They are also typically\
    \ constrained. Thus, opening the economy up to increased trade and to capital\
    \ flows can produce surprisingly large welfare gains and losses, even for those\
    \ living within the very same village.\n\nLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA\n\
