How do profit maximizing firms decide on the level of employment, and on their input/output mix more generally? The problem is broken down into its component parts: feasible production technology, and the prices of inputs and outputs. Predictions are made for individual firmsâ€™ responses to domestic price changes with implications for profits. Surprisingly, the same constructs can be used for economy-wide responses to international tariffs, with implications for household welfare.
